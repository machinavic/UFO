##Analysis
In this chapter, the intention was to learn about the use of JavaScript to interact and create webpages, building it, adding data, filtering dat, among others not less important.

##Overview of the analysis:

In this particular case, a webpage was created and a dynamic table was added to it with thw ability the user be able to filter thru the data and get the info they request.

##Results:

Some cells were added to the table, not only data but city, state, country and the filter button to interact with the info displayed in the web.

Honestly, the web here displayed all the requested results but I didn't like how the cells for the filters were aligned.

##Summary:

Honestly, this topic with JavaScript is one of the most I need to learn and develop my skills, but not bad to be the fisrt time doing it.
